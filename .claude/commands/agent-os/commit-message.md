# Commit Staged Changes

Use the **commit-message-writer** subagent to commit staged changes with a
well-crafted message.

The subagent will:

1. Read the project's commit message standards
2. Analyze staged changes
3. Write a value-focused commit message following the standards
4. Execute the commit

Provide the subagent with any additional context about the changes if relevant.
