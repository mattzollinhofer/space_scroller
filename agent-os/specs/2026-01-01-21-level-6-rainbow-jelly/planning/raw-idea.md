# Raw Idea

## Roadmap Item 21

Add a new level, level 6. This will mostly use the same approach as all
previous levels. A few notes:

a. theme is rainbow colored jelly

b. there is a new boss: jelly monster
   i. the boss has a custom attack sprite (weapon-jelly)
   ii. the boss has a custom attack sequence:
       1) enter
       2) up and down while shooting
       3) grow 4x larger then shrink to normal size
       4) rapid jelly attack
       5) repeat

c. there is a new enemy called jelly snail. add to spawn sequence. slow
   zig-zag movement. 5 health. slow shooting. 10ish (+/- 3) per level
