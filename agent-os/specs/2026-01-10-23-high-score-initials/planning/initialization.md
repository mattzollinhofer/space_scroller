# Spec Initialization

## Roadmap Item
23. High Score Initials - Allow the player to enter their three-letter initials when achieving a high score, old-school arcade style. Display initials alongside scores on the high score screen.

## Initial Description
Add classic arcade-style initials entry to the high score system. When a player achieves a score that qualifies for the top 10, they should be prompted to enter three-letter initials (like "AAA" or "MJK"). These initials should be displayed alongside scores on both the game over/level complete screens and on a dedicated high score screen accessible from the main menu.

## Context
- The current high score system stores top 10 scores with timestamps but no player identification
- High scores are displayed on game over and level complete screens
- Main menu has a "High Scores" button that is currently a placeholder
- Target audience is kids ages 6-12

## Size Estimate
S (Small)
